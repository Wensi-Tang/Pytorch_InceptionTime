# Pytorch_InceptionTime

This is Pytorch implementation of a 1D-CNN Time-series classification model [InceptionTime](https://github.com/hfawaz/InceptionTime)


I test my code with the environment below:
### Environment 
python == 3.5  
pytorch == 1.1.0  
scikit-learn == 0.21.3

His results on 128 UCR datasets can be found at [here](https://github.com/hfawaz/InceptionTime/blob/master/results-inception-128.csv)

The Accuracy comparison on UCR 128 datasets with one time run is below
